# Command line arguments and environment variables

The type of programs like the hello world program we compiled in previous example can be really useful, but only less often.
More often programs should be able to take take some data from us, process it and produce output. For e.g, Uber takes the GPS location of where we stand to figure out which taxi to send us. There are a variety of methods in which a program can take data from its user and in this lesson we will learn 2 - command line arguments and environment variables.


TODO: 
./printEnv
This program should print environment variable "arun" and "number". Use std::getenv function in c++ to do that. When the env variables are not available, print a "hello not set" and "number not set" message.
export hello="hello c++"
export number=323
 
explain ~/.bashrc and /etc/environment

explain system environment variable PATH
explain export PATH=$PATH:.
