# File Descriptors in C++

File descriptors are low-level integer handles used by the operating system to access files and I/O resources. In C++, especially when using POSIX APIs, file descriptors provide a way to interact directly with files, sockets, and other resources.

## Basics

- **0**: Standard Input (`stdin`)
- **1**: Standard Output (`stdout`)
- **2**: Standard Error (`stderr`)

When you open a file using system calls like `open()`, the OS returns a file descriptor. Let's make a program that opens a text file, reads its contents, prints that content, and write some new text into it.

## Example: File I/O Using File Descriptors

```cpp
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0644);

    if (fd == -1)
    {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open file\n";
        return 1;
    }
    // Read from the file
    lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET); // Move file pointer to the beginning
    char buffer[200];
    ssize_t bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    if (bytesRead > 0)
    {
        buffer[bytesRead] = '\0'; // Null-terminate
        std::cout << "Read from file: " << buffer << "\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "File was empty.\n";
    }

    const char *msg = "Hello, file descriptors!\n";
    int len = strlen(msg);
    write(fd, msg, len); // Append to the file using the descriptor
    std::cout << "Appending some content to the file...\n";
    close(fd); // Always close when done
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

- Use `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` for file descriptor operations.
- Always close file descriptors to avoid resource leaks.

File descriptors are essential for low-level file and device I/O in C++ on Unix-like systems.
