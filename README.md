# Introduction to programming and shell (Linux)

In this course, we will get started with our programming journey. We will be learning critical fundamentals of programming and compilers through `C++ clang compiler` and `linux bash shell`. In the era of vibe coding where english becomes the programming language, knowledge of how to use Unix pipes will make you stand out from the crowd. No pre-requisite knowledge is necessary.
